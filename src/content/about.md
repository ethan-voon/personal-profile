Born in Visalia, CA and raised in the Pacific Northwest. Today you can find me in the city of subdued excitement –Bellingham, WA. I share a home with my life partner, Ellie, and our [loud] cattle dog, Indi.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Western Washington University in 2017. Since then, I have been a software engineer at Faithlife where I build modern web apps and back-end services.

I was raised in a house of music and continue to play whatever instrument I can get my hands on. Most often that end's up being a ukulele.

I have a passion for community. I seek to love and support my neighbors and foster an environment of trust and mutual respect. This is not limited to my geographical community but applies across all commonalities that bind me to others in the universe.

I love one on one discussions! Please don't be shy and feel free to reach out about anything anytime.
