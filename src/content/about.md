Born in Visalia, CA and raised throughout the Pacific Northwest. Today you can find me in the ‘City of Subdued Excitement’ – Bellingham, WA. I share a home with my life partner, Ellie, and our _loud_ cattle dog, Indi. We are expecting our first baby to be born in October 2020!

I was brought up in a house of music and continue to play whatever instrument I can get my hands on. Most often that ends up being a ukulele. If you want to get a feel for my musical taste, check out my [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ylNKwah8Zb31fs5jPDMnl?si=q9o0FbIcQsK37dSyB0Npzg) or my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/ethanvoon).

I attended Capital High School in Olympia, WA and graduated in 2010. The next 7 years consisted of part/full-time work at GameStop and part/full-time course loads at South Puget Sound Community College followed by Western Washington University. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from WWU in 2017. Following graduation, I worked as an intern at Faithlife and earned a full-time position at the end of the summer. During my tenure at Faithlife I developed the skills of a full-stack developer by working on web APIs, internal tools, and React applications. Now I'm discovering a newfound passion for community and building with the simple mission of improving the lives of those around me.

I love one on one discussions! Please, don’t be shy and feel free to reach out about anything anytime.
