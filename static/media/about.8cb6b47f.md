I am discovering my passion for community.

I seek to love and support my neighbors and foster an environment of trust and mutual respect.
This is not limited to my geographical community but applies across all commonalities that bind me to others.

I love one on one discussions! Please don't be shy and feel free to reach out about anything anytime.

# Bio

Born in Visalia, CA and raised throughout the Pacific Northwest. Today you can find me in the 'City of Subdued Excitement' – Bellingham, WA. I share a home with my life partner, Ellie, and our **loud** cattle dog, Indi. We are expecting our first child to be born in October 2020!

## Hobbies

I was raised in a house of music and continue to play whatever instrument I can get my hands on. Most often that end's up being a ukulele. I also enjoy listening to music (crazy, I know).
If you want to get a feel for my musical taste, check out my [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ylNKwah8Zb31fs5jPDMnl?si=q9o0FbIcQsK37dSyB0Npzg) or my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/ethanvoon).

It would be wrong for me not to mention video games here.
Though I play much less than I used to, games have been a consistent hobby since my parents bought me my teal Game Boy Color and a copy of _Wario Land 3_ in the early 2000s. I've been a Nintendo fan ever since.
I got into PC gaming during high school and eventually ended up with the cancer known as _League of Legends_. After 10 long years battling that disease, I'm finally in remission. Though I do fear it returning one day...

I am currently trying my hand at some basic wood-working. It's... coming along.

## Career & Education

I attended Capital High School in Olympia, WA and graduated in 2010.

The next 7 years consisted of part/full-time work at Gamestop and part/full-time course loads at South Puget Sound Community College and Western Washington University.

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from WWU in 2017.

Following graduation, I took an internship at Faithlife and earned a full-time position at the end of the summer. During my tenure at Faithlife I developed the skills of full-stack developer by working on web APIs, internal tools, and React applications.

Now I am building product with the simple mission of improving the lives of those around me.
