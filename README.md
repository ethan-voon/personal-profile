## Ethan Voon's Github Pages Website

I decided to opt-out of a generic template or website builder. Instead, I wrote this site using react and github pages. This decision came about primarily because I wanted a project to practice learning react and front-end web development.

Feel free to let me know what parts of my code are bad, ugly, or if you have any compliments! I'm a life learner and love improving what I create.
